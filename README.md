Thots, A MicroPost
=========

A microposts blogging website created using Flask and Python. Thanks to Miguel Grinberg for the great [tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

Installation
------------

The tutorial referenced above explains how to setup a virtual environment with all the required modules.
 
The sqlite database must also be created before the application can run, and the `db_create.py` script takes care of that. See the [Database tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database) for the details.

Running
-------

To run the application in the development web server just execute `run.py` with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.
